Specifically, I come from a Silicon Valley tech incubator, Stanford. Stanford is its own census-designated place, though often thought of as Palo Alto. For a history of Palo Alto and the influence of the tech industry, I highly recommend Malcolm Harris's recent book, Palo Alto.

::: {.notes}
I see tremendous opportunities for this technology to support the work of librarians and to improve our services to patrons. But it requires us to engage with the technology, understand its limitations, its capabilities, and how we can put it to work to benefit us.

## AI is prediction based on examples


::: {.notes}
As a result, it is simply a reflection of the information it has been trained on.

Refik Anadol, "[Archive Dreaming](codaworx.com/project/archive-dreaming-salt-research)"
"Archive Dreaming" trained on 1.7 million document images from [SALT archive](https://archives.saltresearch.org/) is a project to "reframe memory, history, and culture in museum perception for the 21st century through the lens of machine intelligence."


Mimi Ọnụọha, Everything That Didn’t Fit, Bitforms Gallery, 2022
"Everything That Didn’t Fit is an ode to absence, and a call to undo and expand the categories of value that inform modern sociotechnical systems."

Mimi Ọnụọha, The Library of Missing Datasets, 2016
